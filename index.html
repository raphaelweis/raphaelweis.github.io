    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently a software engineering student, at 20 years of age. I
      started my academic journey by a DUT (Diplôme universitaire de
      technologie) in mechanical and production engineering - because I was
      unsure of what I wanted to do with my career. At the end of my diploma, I
      was exposed to VBA during an internship at Renault Trucks, and began to
      develop a growing interest in software engineering. Luckily for me, I was
      able to apply to and successfully enter in the computer science major of
      the University of Technology of Troyes, a well renowned school based in
      Troyes, France. That was back in 2022. I am now well into my software
      journey, and have never looked back on my career choices since. I’ve
      learned a tremendous amount of things over the past two years, and
      continue doing so to this day. I have proven to myself I could do this at
      a professional level during an internship at Orange (French network
      operator leader) in 2023 which resulted in me getting the highest grade
      possible. I am now back to studying, and will seek another internship in
      2025, for my final semester before graduation.
    </p>

    <h3>What I currently do</h3>
    <p>
      I am now back in Troyes for a regular semester, until summer 2024. This
      semester, I took the following classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Human-machine interface and ergonomics.</li>
      <li>Foresight and Environmental Philosophy.</li>
      <li>Corporate Financial Engineering.</li>
      <li>Introduction to information systems security.</li>
      <li>Management of software projects in an agile way.</li>
      <li>Understanding and applying the basics of artificial intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My most significant project</h3>
    <p>
      Back in July 2023, I started my first internship as a software engineer,
      at Orange, a French multinational telecommunications corporation,
      employing over 130 000 people worldwide. I was put to work on a project in
      the R&D department, as an intern software engineer. The project I worked
      on, named Scambio (Italian for transaction), was created after the
      appearance of the PSD2, the European Payment Service Directive 2, a
      directive which opened the use of wire transfer payments by third party
      companies (that is, companies other than banks) to collect payments
      online. Orange partnered with Fintecture, a French startup, to start
      developing a product making use of the new regulations, and this is the
      product I was put to work on. As part of the main development team, I was
      able to make contributions to both the backend and the frontend, and was
      given a great deal of autonomy to experiment, make changes and put out new
      features. During this 6 month span, my most notable achievements were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Completely revamped the frontend of the application to match the Orange
        style guidelines and accommodate new features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduced breaking changes in the backend enabling new features for the
        users, resulting in a new API version (Note that this project has not
        been released to the public yet, which made this kind of changes
        possible).
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimized the local development process by standardizing the local setup
        to run the database and the server on any given machine.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I notably worked with the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flutter for the frontend (mostly).</li>
      <li>GO for the backend.</li>
      <li>MongoDB as a database.</li>
      <li>Docker and OpenShift for deployments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As I have stated before, I was able to score the highest grade possible on
      this internship, and as such consider this experience a true success. I
      was able to provide real value for the project, and the company as a
      whole, and learned the most out of any of my academic semesters so far. I
      take back this experience with me to continue my studies, and strive to
      hone my technical and academical skills before seeking another internship,
      in 2025.

    <h3>About this website</h3>
    <p>
      This website was made with the most basic technologies the web has to
      offer. No libraries, no frameworks, no bundle, just plain HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. And you can see it, it’s boring. It doesn’t have much color,
      only one image, and the rest is just plain black text on a white
      background. This is on purpose. Do you want to know what this website does
      have though ?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It loads extremely fast. (That was simple, there is almost nothing to
        load, it is just plain text, remember ?)
      </li>
      <li>
        It has the information you need. You came here expecting to get more
        info about me, and you got it. And you were able to see it fast, I know
        your time is precious.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is accessible. I’ve read through the W3C guidelines regarding
        accessibility, according special attention to the handling of text on
        this website. You should be able to change the font to your liking using
        your browser settings, to increase or decrease the font size to what
        suits you best, and to view this website on whatever device you have on
        hand.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now I know what you want to say. “This website is extremely simple, it was
      very easy to implement all the things you mentioned above!”. And you’re
      absolutely right. This website is fast and accessible, because there isn’t
      much to it. And I believe there doesn’t need to be. I have experience
      building complex and reactive UI’s. But I also want to keep things simple
      when they can be. I could have showcased some of my UI building skills in
      this website, instead I chose to make it this way. Because the web should
      be simple, when it can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew heavy inspiration from the following project: M***********g
      Website. Of course, this had to be more polite. It’s a portfolio website,
      after all.
