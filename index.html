<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
  I am currently a software engineering student, at 21 years of age. I
  started my academic journey by a DUT (Diplôme universitaire de
  technologie) in mechanical and production engineering - because I was
  unsure of what I wanted to do with my career. At the end of my diploma, I
  was exposed to VBA during an internship at
  <a href="https://www.renault-trucks.com" target="_blank">Renault Trucks</a
  >, and began to develop a growing interest in software engineering.
  Luckily for me, I was able to apply to and successfully enter the
  computer science major of the
  <a href="https://www.utt.fr" target="_blank"
  >University of Technology of Troyes</a
  >, a well renowned school based in Troyes, France. That was back in 2022.
  I am now well into my software journey, and have never looked back on my
  career choices since. I’ve learned a tremendous amount of things over the
  past three years, and continue doing so to this day. I have proven to myself
  I could do this at a professional level during an internship at
  <a href="https://www.orange.com" target="_blank">Orange</a>
  (French network operator leader) in 2023 which resulted in me getting the
  highest grade possible. I am now back to studying, and seeking another
  internship in 2025, for my final semester before graduation.
</p>

<h3>What I currently do</h3>
<p>
  I am now back in Troyes for a regular semester, until january 2025. This
  semester, I took the following classes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fundamentals of software engineering project management.</li>
  <li>Reducing the environmental impact of digital services.</li>
  <li>Secure design of android applications.</li>
  <li>Mastering the fundamentals of IT infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My most significant project</h3>
<p>
  Back in July 2023, I started my first internship as a software engineer,
  at , a French multinational telecommunications corporation, employing over
  130 000 people worldwide. I was put to work on a project in the R&D
  department, as an intern software engineer. The project I worked on, named
  Scambio (Italian for transaction), was created after the appearance of the
  PSD2, the European Payment Service Directive 2, a directive which opened
  the use of wire transfer payments by third party companies (that is,
  companies other than banks) to collect payments online.
  <a href="https://www.orange.com" target="_blank">Orange</a> partnered with
  <a href="https://www.fintecture.com" target="_blank">Fintecture</a>, a
  French startup, to start developing a product making use of the new
  regulations, and this is the product I was put to work on. As part of the
  main development team, I was able to make contributions to both the
  backend and the frontend, and was given a great deal of autonomy to
  experiment, make changes and put out new features. During this 6 month
  span, my most notable achievements were:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Completely revamped the frontend of the application to match the Orange
    style guidelines and accommodate new features.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introduced breaking changes in the backend enabling new features for the
    users, resulting in a new API version (Note that this project has not
    been released to the public yet, which made this kind of changes
    possible).
  </li>
  <li>
    Optimized the local development process by standardizing the local setup
    to run the database and the server on any given machine.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>I notably worked with the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://flutter.dev" target="_blank">Flutter</a> for the
    frontend (mostly).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">Golang</a> for the backend.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.mongodb.com" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> as a
    database.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> and
    <a
      href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift"
      target="_blank"
    >OpenShift</a
    >
    for deployments.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As I have stated before, I was able to score the highest grade available on
  this internship, and as such consider this experience a true success. I
  was able to provide real value for the project, and the company as a
  whole, and learned the most out of any of my academic semesters so far. I
  take back this experience with me to continue my studies, and strive to
  hone my technical and academical skills before seeking another internship,
  in late 2025.
