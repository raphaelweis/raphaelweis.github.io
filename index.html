    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently a software engineering student, at 20 years of age. I
      started my academic journey by a DUT (Diplôme universitaire de
      technologie) in mechanical and production engineering - because I was
      unsure of what I wanted to do with my career. At the end of my diploma, I
      was exposed to VBA during an internship at
      <a href="https://www.renault-trucks.com" target="_blank">Renault Trucks</a
      >, and began to develop a growing interest in software engineering.
      Luckily for me, I was able to apply to and successfully enter in the
      computer science major of the
      <a href="https://www.utt.fr" target="_blank"
        >University of Technology of Troyes</a
      >, a well renowned school based in Troyes, France. That was back in 2022.
      I am now well into my software journey, and have never looked back on my
      career choices since. I’ve learned a tremendous amount of things over the
      past two years, and continue doing so to this day. I have proven to myself
      I could do this at a professional level during an internship at
      <a href="https://www.orange.com" target="_blank">Orange</a>
      (French network operator leader) in 2023 which resulted in me getting the
      highest grade possible. I am now back to studying, and will seek another
      internship in 2025, for my final semester before graduation.
    </p>

    <h3>What I currently do</h3>
    <p>
      I am now back in Troyes for a regular semester, until summer 2024. This
      semester, I took the following classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Human-machine interface and ergonomics.</li>
      <li>Foresight and Environmental Philosophy.</li>
      <li>Corporate Financial Engineering.</li>
      <li>Introduction to information systems security.</li>
      <li>Management of software projects in an agile way.</li>
      <li>Understanding and applying the basics of artificial intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My most significant project</h3>
    <p>
      Back in July 2023, I started my first internship as a software engineer,
      at , a French multinational telecommunications corporation, employing over
      130 000 people worldwide. I was put to work on a project in the R&D
      department, as an intern software engineer. The project I worked on, named
      Scambio (Italian for transaction), was created after the appearance of the
      PSD2, the European Payment Service Directive 2, a directive which opened
      the use of wire transfer payments by third party companies (that is,
      companies other than banks) to collect payments online.
      <a href="https://www.orange.com" target="_blank">Orange</a> partnered with
      <a href="https://www.fintecture.com" target="_blank">Fintecture</a>, a
      French startup, to start developing a product making use of the new
      regulations, and this is the product I was put to work on. As part of the
      main development team, I was able to make contributions to both the
      backend and the frontend, and was given a great deal of autonomy to
      experiment, make changes and put out new features. During this 6 month
      span, my most notable achievements were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Completely revamped the frontend of the application to match the Orange
        style guidelines and accommodate new features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduced breaking changes in the backend enabling new features for the
        users, resulting in a new API version (Note that this project has not
        been released to the public yet, which made this kind of changes
        possible).
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimized the local development process by standardizing the local setup
        to run the database and the server on any given machine.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I notably worked with the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://flutter.dev" target="_blank">Flutter</a> for the
        frontend (mostly).
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">GO</a> for the backend.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.mongodb.com" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> as a
        database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> and
        <a
          href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift"
          target="_blank"
          >OpenShift</a
        >
        for deployments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As I have stated before, I was able to score the highest grade possible on
      this internship, and as such consider this experience a true success. I
      was able to provide real value for the project, and the company as a
      whole, and learned the most out of any of my academic semesters so far. I
      take back this experience with me to continue my studies, and strive to
      hone my technical and academical skills before seeking another internship,
      in 2025.

    <h3>About this website</h3>
    <p>
      This website was made with the most basic technologies the web has to
      offer. No libraries, no frameworks, no bundle, just plain HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. And you can see it, it’s boring. It doesn’t have much color,
      only one image, and the rest is just plain black text on a white
      background. This is on purpose. Do you want to know what this website does
      have though ?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It loads extremely fast. (That was simple, there is almost nothing to
        load, it is just plain text, remember ?)
      </li>
      <li>
        It has the information you need. You came here expecting to get more
        info about me, and you got it. And you were able to see it fast, I know
        your time is precious.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is accessible. I’ve read through the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22" target="_blank"
          >W3C guidelines regarding accessibility</a
        >, according special attention to the handling of text on this website.
        You should be able to change the font to your liking using your browser
        settings, to increase or decrease the font size to what suits you best,
        and to view this website on whatever device you have on hand.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now I know what you want to say. “This website is extremely simple, it was
      very easy to implement all the things you mentioned above!”. And you’re
      absolutely right. This website is fast and accessible, because there isn’t
      much to it. And I believe there doesn’t need to be. I have experience
      building complex and reactive UI’s. But I also want to keep things simple
      when they can be. I could have showcased some of my UI building skills in
      this website, instead I chose to make it this way. Because the web should
      be simple, when it can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew heavy inspiration from the following project:
      <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">M***********g Website</a>. Of
      course, this had to be more polite. It’s a portfolio website, after all.
