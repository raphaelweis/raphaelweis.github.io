# About me

Hello. My name is RaphaÃ«l Weis, and I am a french final-year computer science student at the University of Technology of Troyes. I made this portfolio website in order to showcase some of the projects I've worked on as well as provide a little more details on my software engineering journey. If you think I could be a good fit for your company, don't hesitate to contact me either on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/raphaelweis) or via email at [raphael.weis.g@gmail.com](mailto:raphael.weis.g@gmail.com).

## About this website

This website was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and basic web technologies (no external dependencies). You may check out the source code [here](https://github.com/raphaelweis/raphaelweis.github.io) or the hugo theme I wrote [here](https://github.com/raphaelweis/hugo-md3-theme). If you notice something wrong with the theme, do not hesitate to open an issue.

The design of this website was heavily inspired by designs from google's websites, and in particular the [Material 3 guidelines website](https://m3.material.io). I find the material 3 visual style to be visually appealing, and I use the guidelines in almost all of my frontend work, to ensure visual consistency and accessibility.
